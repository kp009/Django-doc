# Django Web App

This is a Django web application that you can deploy to Azure or other cloud platforms. It is a simple app to get started with Django and Docker. This project is configured to be deployed using **Docker**, **Azure App Service**, and **GitHub** for continuous deployment.

## Features

- **Django-based Web App** with basic configurations.
- **Dockerized application** for easy local development and deployment.
- **Azure App Service** integration for cloud deployment.
- Uses **MySQL database** for persistent storage.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Python 3.x** and **Pip**
- **Docker** (for local containerization)
- **Git** (for version control)
- **Azure CLI** (for managing Azure resources)
- **Docker Compose** (for managing multi-container Docker applications)

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository

Clone this repository to your local machine using Git:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kp009/Django-doc.git
cd Django-doc
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

Ensure that your environment has the necessary dependencies. Install Python packages listed in `requirements.txt`:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Set Up MySQL Database

This project uses **MySQL** for data storage. You can run a MySQL container locally or connect to an external MySQL database.

#### Run MySQL Using Docker (Optional)

If you prefer to use Docker to run MySQL locally, you can do so using Docker Compose:

```bash
docker-compose up -d mysql-db
```

This will start the MySQL container with the necessary configuration. You can modify the database connection settings in `settings.py` or the `docker-compose.yml` file if needed.

### 4. Run the Django Development Server

Run the Django development server locally to check that everything is working as expected:

```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

Access the app at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`.

### 5. Build the Docker Image

If you want to run the app in a container, you can build the Docker image using the provided `Dockerfile`:

```bash
docker build -t django-docker-app .
```

### 6. Run the Docker Container

Once the Docker image is built, you can run it with:

```bash
docker run -d -p 8000:8000 django-docker-app
```

This will run the app on `http://localhost:8000/`.

## Deployment

This project can be deployed to **Azure App Service** for production use. Here's how to set it up:

### 1. Set Up Azure App Service

Follow the steps in the Azure portal to create an **App Service**. You will need to link this app to your GitHub repository for continuous deployment.

- Go to the **Deployment Center** in the Azure portal and choose **GitHub** as the source.
- Authenticate and select your repository and branch.

### 2. Set Up Continuous Deployment

- Ensure that **Continuous Deployment** is enabled in the Azure portal, so the app automatically deploys when you push changes to your GitHub repository.
  
### 3. Docker Container Deployment

- Set up the **Docker container** in your Azure App Service.
- In the **App Service** configuration, specify the Docker image: `djangodoc.azurecr.io/django-app:v1`.

### 4. Configure Environment Variables

Set up the necessary environment variables for the Django app, including your **database credentials** and any other settings required by your app.

## Environment Variables

Make sure to set the following environment variables for your app:

- **MYSQL_DATABASE**: The name of your MySQL database.
- **MYSQL_USER**: The MySQL username.
- **MYSQL_PASSWORD**: The MySQL password.
- **MYSQL_HOST**: The hostname or IP address of your MySQL server (e.g., `localhost` for local Docker, or the Azure database URL).
- **MYSQL_PORT**: The port for your MySQL database (usually `3306`).

You can add these variables in the **Azure App Service** environment settings.
